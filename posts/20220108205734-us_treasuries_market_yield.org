Which was always pretty high before the financial crisis and explains why financial advice books recommend to buy them. Now short maturity hits the floor; 30-Y is still ok-ish.

/Negatve nominal rates is a rather new thing/

It is however more interesting to look at this but adjusted by the % change of the [[id:b5f5e019-e22f-49b6-bfb5-ef03c8b0c41b][Consumer Price Index]], because you should [[id:05892055-b714-4778-b010-8cea60f7f514][Always compare yields to inflation]].

The same thing is happening to corporate bonds:

It is clear that the same thing is [[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=KFco][happening to corporate bonds]] which could be explained by [[id:8ff4eef8-ed3d-405f-9658-7f390a06ecc1][Quantitative Easing]].

* TODO Is it what we want to chart?
Looks like it might be change since last year (which would explain the 1200% increases)
* TODO Replot CPI-adjusted 1M treasuries yield
* TODO Plot 10Y adjusted treasuries vs corporate bonds adjusted
* TODO Show spread between above quantities
* TODO Show spread between 10Y and 1M nominal rates
