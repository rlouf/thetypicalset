To do evil you need an absolute moral reference point that /justifies/ actions that would otherwise be comdemable. To do evil you need to do a /lesser/ evil. The notion of evil, once introduced, is indeed self-referential, and morally allows /more/ evil to exist. To break the spiral is to point out that evil is non essential (nothing and no one comes to existence evil) but a construction, like Hannah Arendt did.

Look at what has happened in the late 2010s-early 2020s with the social justice movement. Members who went too far where convinced that their targets were /evil/.

Qualifying someone as /evil/ is to deny their humanity.
