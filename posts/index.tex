ðŸ‘‹ I am RÃ©mi (\href{mailto:remi@thetypicalset.com}{email}, \href{https://twitter.com/remilouf}{twitter})

You've just stepped on \textbf{the typical set}, a subset of my personal notes, my blog, and some longform write ups. Feel
free to explore. You can start with what I am doing now and what I am working
on.

I am a glorified statistician (some say \href{https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century}{data scientists}) and software developer. I am currently a very busy freelance. I am particularly interested in bayesian statistics \& generative modeling, mcmc sampling and symbolic computing, which translate into my professional life and the open source projects I contribute to:

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax}{Blackjax} is a sampling (mostly MCMC) library that is built with JAX for ease of use, speed and modularity.
\item \href{https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc}{Aemcmc} is a sampling library built with Aesara which builds samplers from model graphs. \href{https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc}{Aehmc}
implements symbolic HMC and NUTS samplers, but will likely merge into Aemcmc.
\item \href{https://github.com/rlouf/mcx}{MCX} is an experimental PPL, deprecated in favor of Blackjax and Aesara/Aeppl. \href{blog/introducing-mcx.org}{Read the blog post}.
\end{itemize}


Unlike a traditional blog, most of the notes you will find here are \textbf{constant
work in progress}. They are mostly written for myself. Many of them are stubs,
ideas waiting to be explored. They coalesce in \href{blog/index.org}{blog posts} (which are often
\emph{timely}) or longer \href{file:///home/remi/projects/blog/.dir-locals.el}{projects} which aim at being evergreen bur are written for others.

With this experiment I am also trying to figure out how to write useful notes, and how to
efficiently navigate between them.

These notes are generated with \href{https://www.orgroam.com/}{Org-roam} and are automatically published with \href{https://www.orgmode.org/fr/}{Org Mode}.
