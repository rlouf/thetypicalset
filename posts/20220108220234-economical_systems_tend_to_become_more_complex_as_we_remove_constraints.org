#+title: Economical systems tend to become more complex as we remove constraints
#+filetags: :inbox:

As we remove constraints from an economical system we create new degrees of freedom on the private side. Doing so we do simplify the states' role in the economy (and the politicians' job) but the financial systems hates void, and wil inevitably fill it with an intricate mess of complex stuff. Entropy increased, system is less understandable and arguably more fragile.

The state is Maxwell's daemon. But no, instead of being the daemon it should create structure that prevents entropy from being created in the first place.

Democratic process cristallizes people's divergent opinions, and this is what decreases entropy.

*State intervention is what saves us from the second law of thermodynamics*
*The democratic process is what reduces entropy*
