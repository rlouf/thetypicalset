I suspect that oil prices are behind what we call inflation, because [[id:28820ed1-02d3-4979-84b5-684de4e565ca][you need energy to produce stuff]] and if the price of energy increases then the price of everything does increase. I think where prices meet raw materials and energy is where we understand what price really is about.
