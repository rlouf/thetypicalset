This book was recommended to me to increase the variance of [[id:911c1ce7-5f95-4047-b724-91cd06761533][what I read]], which it did! The authors' thesis is that a couple of tweaks to markets (land, vote, immigration, data) could lead to a better, fairer, etc. world. During almost 3 hundred pages the authors walk the very perilous line that consists in acknowledging the markets' worst flaws while praising for /more or the same/ to cure these ills.

This book can be neatly classified in the [[id:dc6265ec-ac9f-4013-b520-fab1ca370321][Economics as an ideology]] (EAAI) category. Devoid of historical perspective (beyond the history of economic thought) and desire to wrestle with the reality of culture, EAAI has this general approach of picking society's ills (poverty, typically) and provide a set of seemingly unrelated miracle solutions. Not without the arrogance that one can indulge in when the remedy they sell is currently inapplicable. This book is no exception.

Don't be deceived by the tone of the review, however, I typically enjoy these book for the new ideas, in the same way I always like a good science-fiction book.


The conflict of right and left is how history progresses in a democracy, torn between the progressives that are thinking about a better world and conservatives who do not want the good parts of the familiar to be forgotten. Democracies like the US set a stage where these two conflicting desires can fight, with a bias against change if not consensual. [[id:255ec922-4342-46ad-8525-b148dac51acb][Democracies are biased towards conservatives]].

This vision has plagued French politics for a while already.

As Marx himself [[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm][wrote in a letter to the (communist) German politician Friedrich Sorge]] about [[id:1db46852-b0ed-433d-8cd8-6ab72f5d7bdf][Henry George]];

He also has the repulsive presumption and arrogance which is displayed by all panacea-mongers without exception.

* Georgism

Or how a single tax with make your lost love return, your hair grow back and end world poverty.

* Quadratic Voting

One virtue of democracies is /robustness/. Simplicity is great. Quadratic voting is an interesting idea for polls, however. People should probably be spending more time thinking about public life, but certainly not about /tools/.

* Immigration
* Financial markets

* Notes :noexport:

p26 - Joan Robinson on imperfect markets. Markets are one of the two sources of stagnequality and political conflict. Other one is lack of market in some areas (??).

p27- One person one vote has weaknesses when people really cares about an issue, most dont so the minority can’t get influence in proportion to the importance for them.

p42- Tax the land at renting value but not the value of what is built on it.

p47- Schumpeter: equivalence between a socialist economy and one big corporation
> Add note with the ref

p54- Texas shoutout principle and origins in ancient Greece? Harberger’s tax.

p77- Not so sure how I feel about people’s attachment to things being dismissed as something of the past.

p82- vote credit vs one person one vote
> Add this book to the democracy reading list

p92- "Voting is a straightjacket that throws out some information" (how much people carte about an issue)

p98- Bentham says citizens should be heard in proportion to how important a given good is to a citizen.
> Problematic with abortion for instance?
> Easy to polarize some portion of the population and make them spend their credit

p114- Use of QV for polling seems to give better results.

p123- Democracy does cause growth (although l’argument est pete)


I see how tempting it might be from a leftist perspective to bash the naivety of these proposals, and I have at filles been remettre to do so. But it would be more productive to establish a dialogue with this utopist branch. Because in the end, although our means are different, our goal is the same : give more agency to the people. It just so happens that we attack the problem from different angles, which in France makes us vote for different parties. But I have no trouble imagining relenting parties not merging, but recognizing that people’s agency is what matters most and find solutions that satisfy both. This who are in it just for the complete deregulation will naturally move to the right and that’s how the left will re -establish itself as a vector for democracy.

There is a renouncement to humanity as it is now, and projection into the future. This is great. I have at time showed animosity towards these views, like I have seen animosity towards anything that

Only role of the state and taxation is economic efficiency.

p184- BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street combined constitue the largest shareholder of 40% of all public companies in the US, 90% of the S&P500

p190- Study by Azar on the airlines as an example of the failures of current capitalism due to institutional investors.

p198- Give arguments against suing institutional investors even though they broke the law.

p201- Monopsony accounts for lagging wage-growth for lower- income workers.

p241- Call Marx to justify people being paid to generate data???
> When economics is your ideology, which it is not, then you are unknowingly advocating another one.

At least they’re acknowledging there is a struggle and unions are good

p241- "Unions also brought many inefficiencies blablabla"

"technical details would be complex” -> I see that everywhere in the book
> It reads as capitalism hiding in complexity once its realized the impossibility to resolve its problems easily

p243- People are called "economic agents" is very striking

p245- Minimum wave not adapted to world of flexible work blabla
> The world it paints for people in the lower income bracket is rather bleak.

p248- "Most people drive a sense of self worth from making a contribution to society"
> somewhat condescending towards gamers.

p253- In this world it is corporations that are steering the world. And while I would like to believe in the humanity of corporation, history unfortunately proves time and times again that economics deprived of a notion of power and a sense of history is a grinding machine.

p260- Another Rube-Goodberg machine to solve a real problem (coercion of people with skills that are les in demand)

p262- "can harm the economy" as a reason to regulate.

p263- Proposal where votes can be bought is probably the scariest of all.

p271- Society, where everything starts, is only given an afterthought

p273- Talk about human limitations finally

p276- "To build a better world we must live beyond the self-defeating conflict of right and left"
> That’s called compromise and that’s how the world works already

There’s nothing wrong with radical ideas, but there’s also nothing wrong with criticizing them. It is weird to reify something that is merely an abstraction to talk about people trading. There is no such thing as a market, there are only human interactions. While it may be the right abstraction to understand the economy it’s incorrect to understand what drives men and what makes great societies. Markets are a small part of what makes us human.

p280- Makes penning a caricature. But price did not contain the wealth of information that’s necessary to do things like climate transition.
> why don’t companies use wage signals to tell people what to work on?
