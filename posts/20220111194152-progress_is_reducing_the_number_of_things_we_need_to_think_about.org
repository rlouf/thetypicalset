We create OUI - Object User Interface - that abstract out the intricacies of objects and rather reflect the /intent/ we had when we designed them, the problem we were trying to solve. APIs are the equivalent in software and [[id:1eb7d036-0133-496e-97de-ae4b92793b89][one does not have to think about a good API]]. Humans can easily reflect at the intent level, which is why pretty much everyone can use an object as complex as a smartphone.

The more seemless the transition between the real world and the intent the less we have to think, the more powerfull the OUI. The process of making OUIs powerfull is called /design./ Successfull companies are usually good at design.
