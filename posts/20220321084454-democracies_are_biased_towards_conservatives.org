The conflict of right and left is how history progresses in a democracy, torn between the progressives that are thinking about a better world and conservatives who do not want the good parts of the familiar to be forgotten. Democracies like the US set a stage where these two conflicting desires can fight, with a bias against change if not consensual. And it's totally fine. It's very obvious with hinsight. First realized this when reading the introduction to Grossmann's [[cite:&grossmann2014][Artists of the Possible]].
