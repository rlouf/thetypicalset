Wars are most often started for self-identification and cohesion of a group than for self-defense. Focus on the /feelings/ that are floating around the war talks rather than the material elements.

Both sides often benefit from the conflict. Us/ versus /them/ is very useful when giving boundaries to a group. Understanding why (modern) wars happen is thus to understand why groups need to be clearly delineated.
