#+title: Ideas are rarely right or wrong
#+filetags: :thoughts:public:

Ideas are rarely completely right or completely wrong but they often have different surface areas over which they're right. Discussion should focus on this, and on whether:

1. We care in practice about each area covered;
2. If we're better off discarding one, or refine both to include the distiction.
