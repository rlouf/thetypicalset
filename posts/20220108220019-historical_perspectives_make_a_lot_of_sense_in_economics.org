[[id:26b12a73-f98e-4beb-80ac-20eceb884242][Economical systems tend to become more complex as we remove constraints]], at the beginning they are fairly simple and we may be able to build models. Then we can move forward in time when new regulation shows up, show data before/after & try to model, etc, etc. It would make a great textbook, and /it would inform policy a lot better than the current mess/.
