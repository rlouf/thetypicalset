This paper proposes another interpretation of the breaking of the Phillips curve in the 1970s: Nixon left
the Gold standard, which ended the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Therefore, the U.S.
economy moved from having a fixed exchange rate with a strong price Phillips curve (which was also a
real exchange rate Phillips curve), to a flexible exchange rate where the correlation would now be between
nominal exchange rate and unemployment, instead of between price inflation and unemployment. In that
interpretation, the breaking of the Phillips curve should not have been interpreted as a triumph of rational
expectations economics, or as a problem for Keynesian economics, but simply as a consequence of a different
exchange rate regime.
