This just makes the world a better place:
- $\alpha\,N_{users}$ more happines for all users;
- $\beta\;N_{users}$ less questions about how the library works;
- $\delta\;N_{users}$ less lines of documentation read;
- Chances are you will realize your abstractions are not all adequate. We realized this while refactoring the API of the looping primitives;
