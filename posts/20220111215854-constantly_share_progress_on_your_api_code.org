Your API is (hopefully) going to be used by a lot of people. If you don't show it immediately you will not have feedback before you've made some irreversible choices. [[id:b035cb34-015c-4be2-a822-85b59a92c020][Progress is better measured in small chunks]]. It is ok to have a loose API definitions at the beginning, as long as you have strong guiding principles.
