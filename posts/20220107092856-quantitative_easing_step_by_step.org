#+title: Quantitative Easing step-by-step

QE happens when the Fed trades with dealers who do not have Fed accounts.

QE is not abount printing money but about changing its composition: fewer treasuries, more bank deposits. The interest rates lower so inverstors are pushed to rebalance their portfolio towards risker assets. It pushes the prices of assets higher, not prices.
