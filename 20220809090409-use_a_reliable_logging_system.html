I know I should meditate more to not get attached to ideas so much, etc. In the meantime dumping everything is great.

The typical set was getting cluttered because there was no buffer between ideas that pop in my head and the website (I <a href="20211203100731-publish_your_notes_instantly.html#ID-9b92383e-727d-4d16-9591-9730222e2d5c">publish my notes instantly</a>). Yet, I still felt that I was losing a lot of material: I could not type notes when I was on the go. I needed a log to dump everything.

The log serves two puposes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A lot of low-quality material, half-baked ideas don't make it here;</li>
<li>On the other hand, I <i>know</i> everything is in there and that I can retrieve it later.</li>
</ul>

I originally tried solutions that were closer to the technology I use for this site (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://logseq.com">logseq</a> allows to edit and export org files). But I am optimizing for <b>efficiency</b> here (and you should too), not for technological compatibility. I just want to log the thought or the reference in a few seconds, and move on with my life. Integration with this website can be done when I am on my computer.
</p>

<p>
I use Notion which. It has a mobile app, and does export the log as a webpage: <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://soundslab.notion.site/soundslab/Log-c873cc5909e54faf91590c68a587841c">here is the log</a>.
