Democracy takes precedence over many concepts. By that I mean that one does not need anything but democracy as an ideal to justify these concepts. <a href="20220215180519-progressive_taxes_are_justified_by_the_need_to_preserve_democracy.html#ID-41209f8c-5f1e-43e5-83bc-742c25e4d97c">Progressive taxes are justified by the need to preserve democracy</a>, for instance: if you don't enforce progressive taxation you risk corruption and people accumulating power that is in competition with people's right to vote. <a href="20220215180859-states_raising_funds_on_financial_markets_is_a_threat_to_democracy.html#ID-88128fec-69c4-4e2d-92ec-303e448cc56c">States raising funds on financial markets is also a threat to democracy</a>: while market pundits will argue markets are democratic, in practice you are signing yourself up for oligarchy: 50% of the US' sovereign debt is owned by 1% of the population. And people who loan money to the State are more likely to be heard than others.
