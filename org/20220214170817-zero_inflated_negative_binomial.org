The Zero-inflated [[id:273bfd3a-7e6e-4971-b422-048f930ae5b0][Negative Binomial]] (ZINB) model adresses both zero inflation and overdispersion in the data. It can be expressed as:

#+begin_src latex :results raw :exports results
\begin{equation*}
 X_j \sim (1-\pi_j)\; \mathds{1}_{w_j=0} + \pi_j\; \operatorname{NegativeBinomial}(\mu_j, r)
\end{equation*}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
\begin{equation*}
 X_j \sim (1-\pi_j)\; \mathds{1}_{w_j=0} + \pi_j\; \operatorname{NegativeBinomial}(\mu_j, r)
\end{equation*}

where the $w_j$ are indivicator variables such that $w_j=x_j=0$ with probability $1-\pi_j$ and $w_j=1$ with probability $\pi_j$. We typically model the $w_j$ using a logistic model.

* Sample

We can use the method described in [[cite:&neelon]] to sample the ZINB model with a logistic mode:

1. Use the Gibbs sampler in [[cite:&polson2013]] to sample the parameter of the logistic regression model;
2. Use the Gibbs sampler in  to sample the parameter of the negative binomial;
3. Update $r$ using a MCMC step;
4. Update the $w_j$ from their discrete full conditional distributions.
