δημοκρατία, dēmokratiā, from dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule

Study of the history of democracy with a focus on ancient Greece and the United States. A few questions for now:
- Can we make an argument in favor of democracy that is not a moral argument? Maybe it is more efficient, the best way to pull a society's resources? Maybe it gives a way for the most powerful to solve their conflicts without violence? Something else? Nevertheless moral arguments should not be overlooked.
- What makes for a thriving democracy? What makes them die?
- Are western democracies, democracies?
