Things I need:
- Be able to view images in emails
- Easily follow links
- Calendar sync
- Be able to mass-delete emails that are not needed anymore
- Be able to use a real text editor to write emails

What I have tried:
- /Gmail:/ It works everywhere and there is no way around it on mobile. Slow experience, poor writing experience, good search but poor batch processing.
- /Mutt:/ It's nice when you spend time to get used to it. I think I did not spend quite enough time to automate things enough that it doesn't become annoying. I remember having sync issues, which was entirely my fault. ==mmsync== to fetch mails is great.

Trying email on emacs now. I want to love email again. It is for many things vastly superior to instant messaging.
