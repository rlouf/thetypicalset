#+title: MCX - lessons learned


I am writing this after a couple of people directly asked me to. I don't think I have any universal lesson to teach to anyone, however I can tell you my story and hopefully it will apply to yours too.

- Work in the open
- Laser-focus on one thing
- Bring crazy ideas to their conclusion
- Trust your insticts
- Know to recognize projects that are greater than you
- Learn to give up
