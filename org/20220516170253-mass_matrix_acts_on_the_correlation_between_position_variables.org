Assume we have an estimate $\Sigma$ of the covariance matrix for $q$. One way to improve sampling is to transform the $q$ so their covariance matrix is close to identity. To do this we write the Cholesky decomposition:

\begin{equation*}
 \Sigma = L^T\,L
\end{equation*}

and write $q' = L^{-1}\,q$. If we use $K(p) = p^{T}\,p\;/2$ we have independent momenta, almost independent positions and HMC should perform well with a small number of leapfrog steps. This transformation is equivalent to using $\Sigma$ as the inverse mass matrix:

\begin{equation*}
 K(p)  = p^{T}\,\Sigma\,p\; / 2
\end{equation*}
