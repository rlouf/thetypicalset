* Condition on transformed variables

Examples of people confused by the inability to condition on deterministic random variables:

There are two cases:
1. Transformation that only involved a single variable, in which case we need to compute the pushforward measure;
1. Transformations that involve several random variables, in which case we need to do some random variable algebra to find a closed form solution if it exists.
