#+title: Adoption of MCMC methods

[[id:5acc4f0f-417e-424f-95a5-1c95e7e822ff][Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] methods [[https://twitter.com/remilouf/status/1611805780784873472?s=20&t=3Nv6QxqIbRLmW8Ukp2Kfsg][suffer from several issues]] among which:

- Getting MCMC to work out of the box is hard;
- Current frameworks are not built for production;
- Hard to express models in a PPL-friendly way;
- No easy-to-use software to cover most common use cases (Bambi);

It would be rather nice to have a tool like

#+begin_src python
import aesara.tensor as at
import aemcmc
import daeploy

srng = at.random.RandomStream(0)

mu_rv = srng.normal(0, 1)
s_rv = srng.halfnormal(1.)
Y_t = srng.normal(0, s_rv)

# samples locally
results = aemcmc.sample(
    {Y_t: data},
    num_warmup=1000,
    num_samples=1000
)

# samples automatically, on the cloud
results = deploy.sample(
    {Y_t: data},
    num_warmup=1000,
    num_samples=1000
)
#+end_src
