A classic line of this kind of book is for the author to pretend that they place themselves "beyond ideologies", that is they only care about the well-being of the people without any preconception or desire about humanity rather than live, trade, die. This is what I call (the expression is not from me unfortunately): *economics as an ideology*. The idea that where people meet, our share legacy (see this review of Pierre Cr√©tois' [[cite:&cretois2020][La Part Commune]] in French for reflection on private property), is mostly in trade. A simple way to spot this is that discourse tends to focus around a bag of tricks and not a coherent vision of who we are, what we want and where we would like to go. As a matter of facts, /"economic agents"/ in often used to designate people.
