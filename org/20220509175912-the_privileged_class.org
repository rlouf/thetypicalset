People like Piketty focus on the top 1% or 0.1% but it is not clear the extent to which in a society where higher education is attained by 20% of the population this is still a useful model to understand political trends.

The /privileged class/ is a concept that I have encounterd in Lasch's /revolt of the elite/ (top 20% of income). I have a vague memory that Louis Maurin makes the same distinction in /Encore Plus/, and probably Emmanuel Todd in /Après la démocracie/.

* TODO Why did Lasch choose to delineate this class?
* TODO How is that model useful? (political trends) :w:
* TODO Where does it fail?
* TODO Rr-read "[[id:12e3b849-e8ff-478e-b972-9d926c26255d][Encore Plus !]]" de Louis Maurin
* TODO Re-read "[[id:677bf4ba-a824-401e-bac9-f5ea2dfde40c][Après la démocratie]]" d'Emmanuel Todd
