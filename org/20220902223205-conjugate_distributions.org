#+title: Conjugate distributions

A pair of a sampling distribution and prior distribution are said to be a /conjugate pair/ if the resulting posterior distribution belongs to the same parametric family of distributions than the sampling distirbution. The prior distribution is said to be a /conjugate prior/ to the sampling distribution.
