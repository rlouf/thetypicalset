I know I should meditate more to not get attached to ideas so much, etc. In the meantime dumping everything is great.

[[id:36a480da-b67f-4f55-8d17-fac346127e40][You need to curate your garden]], or entropy *will* win. The typical set was getting cluttered because there was no buffer between ideas that pop in my head and the website (I [[id:9b92383e-727d-4d16-9591-9730222e2d5c][publish my notes instantly]]). Yet, I still felt that I was losing a lot of material: I could not type notes when I was on the go. I needed a log to dump everything.

The log serves two puposes:
- A lot of low-quality material, half-baked ideas don't make it here;
- On the other hand, I /know/ everything is in there and that I can retrieve it later.

I originally tried solutions that were closer to the technology I use for this site ([[https://logseq.com][logseq]] allows to edit and export org files). But I am optimizing for *efficiency* here (and you should too), not for technological compatibility. I just want to log the thought or the reference in a few seconds, and move on with my life. Integration with this website can be done when I am on my computer.

I use Notion which. It has a mobile app, and does export the log as a webpage: [[https://soundslab.notion.site/soundslab/Log-c873cc5909e54faf91590c68a587841c][here is the log]].
