#+TITLE: The State synchronizes

The state can act on the entirety of the economy almost at once, and does so in a /democratic/ way, that is to say citizens are supposed to have some say over the decisions that are being made. Unlike in a private company. When modern liberals tend to see the state under the regulation lens I prefer to see it under the synchronization lens. The state is giving directions and providing some freedom to do research and to innovate. It makes decisions wherever synchronization is necessary / centralisation is beneficial: energy, infrastructure, formations.
