* TODO Display last update on note
* TODO Handle literature notes
Should have list of authors, link to article (if availabae), etc.

* TODO Better URLS for notes

The current template for naming notes in org-roam is great to avoid conflicts, but it does not make for memorable/pleasant URLS. We should change the notes' slug.

* TODO Improve navigation

See [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][Navigate linked notes]]

** TODO Show the full graph

[[https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/][Hugo Cisneros]] vizualises the graph stored in the Org-roam db with a javascript animation.

** TODO Miller Columns
See [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's notes]] for a great implementation, Jethro Kuan and Neil Mather also use this.

My concern is that Miller columns were designed to navigate trees, but the typical set is more like a directed graph. Apparently Miller worked on a generalized version to browse directed graphs, but could not find more than a mention.

Found [[https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1986/CSD-86-292.pdf][this report]] from 1986 written at the CS division at UC Berkeley.

[[https://medium.com/enigma-engineering/navigating-directed-graphs-90a1fa3f80c8][This blog post]] has neat vizualisation ideas to navigate directed graphs with something that looks like d3.js.

** TODO Show graph neighbourhood in addition to / instead of backlinks

The graph could be shown ont

** TODO Page preview when hovering on a link

Build time is reasonable for now, but I expect it to increase quickly (Neil Mather talks about 50 minute long builds...)
