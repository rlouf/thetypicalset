* Credits

These notes are generated with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]], are automatically published with [[https://www.orgmode.org/fr/][Org Mode]]. They're infused with a healthy dose of nostalgia for [[https://www.spacejam.com/1996/][the]] old [[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html][web]]; the design is essentially the same as this [[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/][motherfucking website]], with 4 lines of CSS to improve readability. I was heavily inspired by [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's notes]] and [[https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/][Neil Mather's digital garden]].

* Work in progress

The typical set is forever a work in progress, on two fronts:
- The /technical solution/: [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][Navigate linked notes]], [[id:9b92383e-727d-4d16-9591-9730222e2d5c][Publish your notes instantly]], [[id:86cc91ce-eb0d-4d42-ac5b-38f6bcbfe678][Reference other people's notes]]

** TODO Display last update on note
** TODO Include larger projects to the typical set
Such as my notes on The Reasoned Schemer. The idea is to have on =publish.el= file per project; all org files in the =/org= directory, and a site map is generated at the root folder as =index.html=.

Which projects to include is listed in the =Makefile=. I don't even need to list the projects as submodules.
** TODO Handle literature notes
Should have list of authors, link to article (if availabae), etc.

** TODO Better URLS for notes

The current template for naming notes in org-roam is great to avoid conflicts, but it does not make for memorable/pleasant URLS. We should change the notes' slug.

** TODO Improve navigation

See [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][Navigate linked notes]]

*** TODO Show the full graph

[[https://hugocisneros.com/blog/my-org-roam-notes-workflow/][Hugo Cisneros]] vizualises the graph stored in the Org-roam db with a javascript animation.

*** TODO Miller Columns
See [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's notes]] for a great implementation, Jethro Kuan and Neil Mather also use this.

My concern is that Miller columns were designed to navigate trees, but the typical set is more like a directed graph. Apparently Miller worked on a generalized version to browse directed graphs, but could not find more than a mention.

Found [[https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1986/CSD-86-292.pdf][this report]] from 1986 written at the CS division at UC Berkeley.

[[https://medium.com/enigma-engineering/navigating-directed-graphs-90a1fa3f80c8][This blog post]] has neat vizualisation ideas to navigate directed graphs with something that looks like d3.js.

*** TODO Show graph neighbourhood in addition to / instead of backlinks

The graph could be shown ont

*** TODO Page preview when hovering on a link

Build time is reasonable for now, but I expect it to increase quickly (Neil Mather talks about 50 minute long builds...)
