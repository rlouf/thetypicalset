#+title: Notebooks to collect references

Sometimes the mere fact of collecting a set of references on a topic can spark new ideas. See for instance [[http://bactra.org/notebooks/][Cosma Shalizi's notebooks]]. Either the note referes to a self-contained fact and it will become an evergreen note, or it will be broken down into several notes of become a project.
