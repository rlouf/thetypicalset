I try to [[id:6db43c67-bc23-480f-92e8-e8c971f61eb2][keep up with reading]]. I'm also trying to improve [[id:98630aaf-4ed8-4678-87d9-8088f7893a54][my routine]].

* I moved out of Paris

I moved to the Fontainebleau area in June 2020, after spending 2 months in my small Paris flat with a 4-year-old and a newborn. The forest is a 2-min walk away. I now have the time and headspace to watch the seasons pass and my children grow.

This is one of the best decisions I made in my life. Kids are much happier, my days are sensibly longer and I am more in tune with my own thoughts and belief than I could ever be in a noisy urban environment. Being an hour away from the city means that you really think twice about taking that coffee, and thus naturally eliminate distractions.

* Gardening

With the new house in need of serious landscaping, I am rekindling my passion for [[id:ecdcbde7-c634-4b64-8159-145cb62b6ce1][gardening]]! I am particularly interested in so-called /naturalistic gardening/ which is all about making visitors feel as if your garden was wild (which is obviously not the case, most natural spaces are way too chaotic). The idea is to have a garden that does not require watering at all, and if it does, to water using water that was collected during rainfalls.

* Injury

I tore my Achilles tendon playing tennis in Feburary; I can now walk almost normally but am still unable to run. This has forced me back to the kind of contemplative life I lived when I was a PhD student. I'd almost say it was all worth it.

* Other intellectual wanderings

- I keep coming back to macroeconomics
- I am currently obsessed with [[file:blog/solve-sudokus-kanren.org][relational]] [[file:blog/zebra-riddle-kanren.org][programming]]
