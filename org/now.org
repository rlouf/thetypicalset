#+title: ðŸŒ¿ Now

I try to [[id:6db43c67-bc23-480f-92e8-e8c971f61eb2][keep up with reading]]. I'm also trying to improve [[id:98630aaf-4ed8-4678-87d9-8088f7893a54][my routine]].

* Moving out of Paris

I moved to the Fontainebleau area in June 2020, after spending 2 months in my small Paris flat with a 4-year-old and a newborn. The forest is a 2-min walk away. I now have the time and headspace to watch the seasons pass and my children grow.

*2022 update* We've bought a house! There's a lot of work ahead of us, but isn't it a nice place already?

I am going back to [[id:ecdcbde7-c634-4b64-8159-145cb62b6ce1][gardening]]!

* Injury

I tore my Achilles tendon playing tennis in Feburary, and I still cannot walk without crutches. This has forced me back to the kind of contemplative life I lived when I was a PhD student. I'd almost say it was all worth it.

* Intellectual wanderings

- I keep coming back to macroeconomics
- I enjoy modeling pretty much anything
- I am reading more and more history
- I am currently obsessed with [[file:blog/solve-sudokus-kanren.org][relational]] [[file:blog/zebra-riddle-kanren.org][programming]]
