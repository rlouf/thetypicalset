* API for variational inference in `blackjax`

Can [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods][variational inference]] (VI) be represented with a kernel? MCMC algorithms are represented as such, for instance for SGLD:

  #+begin_src python
import blackjax

sgld = blackjax.sgld(grad_fn, schedule_fn)
state = sgld.init(init_position, data_batch)
new_state = sgld.step(rng_key, state, data_batch)

  #+end_src

 However, VI is not a stepping process like MCMC is. It /creates a distribution object/ via optimization and then draws samples from that object.

 #+begin_src python
import blackjax

pathfinder = blackjax.pathfinder(logprob_fn)
approximation = pathfinder.approximate(initial_points, num_steps)
samples = pathfinder.sample(approximation, num_samples)
 #+end_src
