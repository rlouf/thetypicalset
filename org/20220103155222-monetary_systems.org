[[cite:&wang2021]] offers a modern account of the monetary system, and although it touches on the Eurodollar a little bit, it is motly US-focused. Reading through this comprehensive account, or any articlet that touches on the topic, I can't help but think "how the hell did we get to something so complicated and so fragile?". This is where a little bit of history cannot hurt. The excellent [[https://maroonmacro.substack.com/][Monetary Mechanics]] newsletter has a series on the history of the monetary system that does a good job at explaining how we moved from one system to the next.

Define what a monetary system. Regulates how you can create money via [[id:0bdd40d5-21a2-4f5e-9f14-8a5738513569][monetary creation]] policies.

How do we measure the amount of liquidity (how do we define liquidity?) in the market? Fed uses M1, M2, M3, but this is somewhat arbitrary.

/What does it mean that we are not able to afford something?/

I feel that /as a nation/ it is only true if we are relying on importations. Otherwise what we have is limited by what we can produce?

* Fiat currency

In 1971 the dollar is not backed by gold anymore (which was a way to prevent the Fed to create too much money?) and becomes a fiat currency. Debt replaces gold. "Debt as good as gold".

*** TODO What is the gold reserve history? What was the purpose? How did the state finance itself?
