[[cite:&wang2021]] offers a modern account of the monetary system, and although it touches on the Eurodollar a little bit, it is motly US-focused. Reading through this comprehensive account, or any articlet that touches on the topic, I can't help but think "how the hell did we get to something so complicated and so fragile?". This is where a little bit of history cannot hurt. The excellent [[https://maroonmacro.substack.com/][Monetary Mechanics]] newsletter has a series on the history of the monetary system that does a good job at explaining how we moved from one system to the next.
