We measure Total Value Locked in smart contracts:

- 2018: from $50 million to $275 million
- 2019: $667 milliom
- 2020: $15.7 billion
- 2021: $86.05 billion

* TODO How much does that represent in BTC (ETH)?
* TODO Does the dollar value increase because ETH increase?
And then it's not =value=, it's just =numbers=
* TODO Can we measure inflow vs outflow in dollar? :noexport:
