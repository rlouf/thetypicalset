Prices in an economy are like monomers in a plastic polymer polymers. Individually there is litte resistance to change, they are not "sticky" as neo-keynesians assume. Looking at all of them as a whole in an economy it becomes /unlikely/ that a bunch of prices will go in the same direction. And indeed in [[cite:&eichenbaum2011]] the authors find that individual prices are not sticky, but /reference prices/ are.

But again, entropic forces can be overcome with coordinated action. [[cite:&smith2017]]

This reminds me that [[id:fed1b560-0477-4429-8d96-6ea6bff6b726][there is no theory of inflation]].
