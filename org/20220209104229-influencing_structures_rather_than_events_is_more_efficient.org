If you consider that [[id:eccc7518-b461-45db-a19c-dd1854ba88e0][democracy is an efficient way to generate good ideas]] then it makes more sense over the long run to try to design a system that (1) sustains this idea-generating systems (2) does its best to extract knowledge/decisions from the system.

Democratic debate is beliefs and ideas propagating on networks where citizens are nodes, and edges are means of communication. Democracy thrives if the debate is effective (instead of having polarized groups) and if the deliberation process extracts information effectively.
