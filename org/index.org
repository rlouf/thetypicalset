#+TITLE: The typical set

ðŸ‘‹ I am RÃ©mi ([[mailto:remi@thetypicalset.com][email]], [[https://twitter.com/remilouf][twitter]], [[https://github.com/rlouf/][Github]], =F7DE17E2ED749DAC14CF60FD5C662F27C81416A1=)

You've just set foot on *the typical set*, a subset of my personal notes, [[file:blog/index.org][my blog]], some longform write-ups. Feel free to explore. You can start with [[id:058ec62c-6022-4eeb-b0a0-e88a75a8b761][what my life is like now]], or [[id:9980ae28-68d4-4e29-9248-d661ccd85ab8][what I am working on and thinking about now]].

* I write software...

I am a statistician (some say [[https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century][data scientist]]) and software engineer working freelance. I am particularly interested in bayesian statistics & generative modeling, mcmc sampling and symbolic computing, which translate into my professional life and the open source projects I contribute to:

- [[https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax][Blackjax]] is a sampling library built with JAX, focused on ease of use, speed and modularity.
- [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc][Aemcmc]] is a sampling library built with Aesara which builds symbolic samplers from model graphs.
- [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc][Aehmc]] provides implementations of samplers in the HMC family (including NUTS) with /Aesara/.
- [[https://github.com/rlouf/mcx][MCX]] is an experimental PPL, deprecated in favor of Blackjax and Aesara/Aeppl. [[file:blog/introducing-mcx.org][Read more about MCX]].

* ...dig rabbit holes...

Unlike a traditional blog, most of the notes you will find here are *constant work in progress*. They form a tightly knit web of related notions. When traditional blogs are engineered, neatly ordered forests, the typical set is more like an aspen grove:

With this experiment I am also trying to figure out [[id:d4b6bab5-96f2-417f-902d-c78e7b7d1dca][how to write useful notes]], and [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][how to efficiently navigate between them]].

* sometimes blog...

Notes that are found in the rabbit hole sometimes coalesce into blog posts. Unlike evergreen notes, blog posts are /time-stamped/ and are thus allowed (sometimes expected) to become /stale/.

* And work on longer pieces

Longer projects aim at [[id:d6361b63-7810-4322-8951-88eb05a9d882][being evergreen but are written for others]]. Updating soon.

* Log

I frequently have random thoughts popping up, interesting references that come up, I gather all these in a [[https://soundslab.notion.site/soundslab/Log-c873cc5909e54faf91590c68a587841c][log in Notion]].
