#+TITLE: The typical set

ðŸ‘‹ I am RÃ©mi ([[mailto:remi@thetypicalset.com][email]], [[https://twitter.com/remilouf][twitter]], [[https://github.com/rlouf/][Github]])

You've just set foot on *the typical set*, a subset of my personal notes, [[file:blog/index.org][my blog]], some longform write-ups. Feel free to explore. You can start with [[id:058ec62c-6022-4eeb-b0a0-e88a75a8b761][what my life is like now]], or [[id:9980ae28-68d4-4e29-9248-d661ccd85ab8][what I am working on and thinking about now]].

* I co-founded a company

I am the CEO of [[https://dottxt.co][.txt]], a company that serves /quality/ tokens. Our work started with [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09702][an ArXiv paper]] on guided generation with Large Language Models, the [[https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines][Outlines library]], but has expanded since. You can find out more about what we do on [[https://txt-ai.github.io/blog/][our blog]].

* I write software...

Before diving into Large Language Models I was particularly interested in Bayesian Statistics and generative modeling, MCMC sampling and symbolic programming. The interests translated into the open source libraries I maintained:

- [[https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines][Outlines]] is a Python library to guide the generation of Large Language models.
- [[id:5a5e87b1-558c-43db-ad38-32a073b10351][Aesara]] is a Python library for defining, rewriting and efficiently evaluating mathematical operations on arrays; A "tensor" library.
- [[id:e18d689a-392a-407a-941a-f0ad2d2dc43e][AePPL]] is a collection of tools for A[e]PPL in Aesara.
- [[id:b0ae89c5-e58d-4525-8c44-074bcaf43c02][Blackjax]] is a sampling library built with JAX, focused on ease of use, speed and modularity.
- [[id:7d019ab6-c3f5-4f63-b689-ece3b88afcc2][AeMCMC]]  is a sampling library built with Aesara which builds symbolic samplers from model graphs.
- [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc][Aehmc]] provides implementations of samplers in the HMC family (including NUTS) with /Aesara/.

* ...dig rabbit holes...

Unlike a traditional blog, most of the notes you will find here are *constant work in progress*. They form a tightly knit web of related notions. When traditional blogs are engineered, neatly ordered forests, the typical set is more like an aspen grove:

With this experiment I am also trying to figure out [[id:d4b6bab5-96f2-417f-902d-c78e7b7d1dca][how to write useful notes]], and [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][how to efficiently navigate between them]].

* sometimes blog...

Notes that are found in the rabbit hole sometimes coalesce into blog posts. Unlike evergreen notes, blog posts are /time-stamped/ and are thus allowed (sometimes expected) to become /stale/.
