#+TITLE: The typical set

ðŸ‘‹ I am RÃ©mi ([[mailto:remi@thetypicalset.com][email]], [[https://twitter.com/remilouf][twitter]])

You've just set foot on *the typical set*, a subset of my personal notes, my blog, some longform write-ups. Feel free to explore. You can start with [[id:058ec62c-6022-4eeb-b0a0-e88a75a8b761][what my life is like now]], or [[id:9980ae28-68d4-4e29-9248-d661ccd85ab8][what I am working on and thinking about now]].


* I write software...

I am a glorified statistician (some say [[https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century][data scientist]]) and software engineer working freelance. I am particularly interested in bayesian statistics & generative modeling, mcmc sampling and symbolic computing, which translate into my professional life and the open source projects I contribute to:

- [[https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax][Blackjax]] is a sampling library built with JAX, focused on ease of use, speed and modularity.
- [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc][Aemcmc]] is a sampling library built with Aesara which builds symbolic samplers from model graphs.
- [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc][Aehmc]] implements symbolic HMC and NUTS samplers, but will likely merge into Aemcmc.
- [[https://github.com/rlouf/mcx][MCX]] is an experimental PPL, deprecated in favor of Blackjax and Aesara/Aeppl. [[file:blog/introducing-mcx.org][Read more about MCX]].

* ...dig rabbit holes...

Unlike a traditional blog, most of the notes you will find here are *constant work in progress*. They are mostly written for myself. Many of them are stubs, ideas waiting to be explored.

With this experiment I am also trying to figure out [[id:d4b6bab5-96f2-417f-902d-c78e7b7d1dca][how to write useful notes]], and [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][how to efficiently navigate between them]].

* sometimes blog...

Notes that are found in the rabbit hole sometimes coalesce into blog posts. Unlike evergreen notes, blog posts are /time-stamped/ and are thus allowed (sometimes expected) to become /stale/.

* And work on longer pieces

Longer projects aim at [[id:d6361b63-7810-4322-8951-88eb05a9d882][being evergreen bur are written for others]]. Updating soon.

* About this website

[[file:img/pikachu-wip.gif]]

These notes are generated with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]], are automatically published with [[https://www.orgmode.org/fr/][Org Mode]]. They're infused with a healthy dose of nostalgia for [[https://www.spacejam.com/1996/][the]] old [[http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html][web]]; the design is essentially the same as this [[https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/][motherfucking website]], with 4 lines of CSS to improve readability. I was heavily inspired by [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy Matuschak's notes]] and [[https://commonplace.doubleloop.net/][Neil Mather's digital garden]].

This website is forever [[file:colophon.org][under construction]].
