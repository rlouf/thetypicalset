#+title: Web navigation is broken

We all have a billion tabs open in our web browser, which makes me think of that old contraption that was used to read from multiple books at the time back in the days. Surely there must be something better as the web is not a collection of books that we can only open one at a time.

Although maybe tabs serve a purpose sometimes.

Some people are still innovating in that space: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt
