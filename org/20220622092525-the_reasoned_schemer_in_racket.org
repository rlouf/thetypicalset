#+TITLE: The Reasoned Schemer in Racket

I have decided to learn Racket with Relational Programming as an excuse. To run /The Reasoned Schemer/'s examples you need to use an implementation of /minikanren/ in Racket. There is a /minikanren/ package available in raco, but it departs from the book's syntax too much for my taste. I prefer to install the canonical implementation in the following way:

#+begin_src bash
raco pkg install github://github.com/miniKanren/Racket-miniKanren/master
#+end_src

Which you can then use by calling

#+begin_src racket
(require "Racket-miniKanren/miniKanren/mk")
#+end_src

in the header.
