Sisyphus's myth starts to make sens when you own a home. Wanting a perfectly functioning home is a losing proposition. [[id:42438bf3-d611-48b5-aba1-046f05a50b27][Life is a constant struggle against the 2nd law of thermodynamics]] and owning a home brings proof. Every day you repair something, enjoy the state of your home for a few days, weeks, until something breaks again and you have to deal with it.

You have to find happiness in this uninterrupted flow.
