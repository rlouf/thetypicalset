- The shape of the init parameter must be statically determined and remain fixed during iterations.
- Result is initialized with the =init= parameter, and updated at each iteration of the body. If condition not met at the first iteration, returns =init=.

* Shapes

There does not seem to be dynamic shapes planned in XLA. But [[https://github.com/google/jax/blob/0400db959be865b3ca312ca3355824f0706723c7/jax/_src/config.py#L860][this in JAX]]. Must be a special kind of dynamic shape, i.e. that can be determined at tracing time.
