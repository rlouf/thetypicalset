It is weird to reify something that is merely an abstraction to talk about people trading. There is no such thing as "the market" (or corporations for that matter), there are only human interactions. While it may be the right abstraction to understand the economy itâ€™s incorrect to understand what drives men and what makes great societies. Markets are a small part of what makes us human.

This would be cute if people were not using this to pretend that decisions taken by a handful of people (whch the market can be in practice) look like a democratic decision (one person one vote).
