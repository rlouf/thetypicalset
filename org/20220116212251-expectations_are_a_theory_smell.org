I think Friedman cooked this up to explain why [[id:7be372a6-07f8-4ee7-b12c-5a9747c46c83][the CPI increases faster since the 70s]]. But bringing information from the future into the present is problematic theoretically speaking. We can /project/ inflation based on what we currently know but certainly cannot use information from the futue in our models. This can lead to [[https://www.econlib.org/archives/2014/03/did_the_rate_in.html][these absurdities]].
