#+title: Garden design

There is a strong biais towards /naturalistic gardening/. The idea behind this school of thought is to recreate the /feel/ of natural environments at a smaller scale. Indeed, random plantings like the ones that occur in the wild are usually boring since the typical size of gardens does not allow for structure to emerge. We thus have to "force" the emergence of these natural structures with the way plants are chosen and arranged.
