#+title: Pollsposition

Pollsposition was created by [[https://twitter.com/alex_andorra][Alex Andorra]] in 2017. The idea is to understand (and predict) political trends using data and bayesian statistics. Models were originally implemented in [[https://pymc.io][PyMC]], but I would like to re-implement them in [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara][Aesara]]. Aesara is more flexible, will hopefully have better (and faster) samplers for the kind of models we want to work with... and is in need of a (public) flagship project.

* TODO Port model for president's popularity to Aesara
* TODO Port the poll averaging model to Aesara
* TODO Implement the model to compute pollster bias
* TODO Ecological inference using election results
What is done in this [[file:blog/drafts/presidentielles-report-voix.org][draft]] for instance.
