Quantitative Easing in fact makes "good debt" (that would be used as HQLA by banks) disappear from the markets, so banks have to build derivatives with the remaining bonds to create reserve.

That's why episodes of quantitative easing do not correspond to lowering interest rates. See [[https://www.action-future.com/index.php/2019/11/07/bund-schatz-yield-fed-qe-ecb-qe/][this curve on the german bond yield w/ periods of QE]].

* Is QE responsible for inflation?

US: 2009-2014
Europe: 2015-2019
Japan: 2000-

Economies exhibited more inflation pre-quantitative easing that after. QE has little impact on the real economy.
