#+title: Kaeras


Kaeras is a deep-learning API that sits on top of Aesara. It is heavily inspired by [[https://keras.io][Keras]], which used to be built on top of Theano, but now on top of Tensorflow 2.

* Minimum Viable Project

A minimum viable library could be to be able to reproduce Keras' documentation' examples. For instance the MNIST convnet:

#+begin_src python
model = keras.Sequential(
    [
        keras.Input(shape=input_shape),
        layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax"),
    ]
)
#+end_src

Which requires the implementation of the following:

- layers.Dense
- layers.Activation
- layers.BatchNormalization
- layers.Conv2D
- layers.MaxPooling2D
- layers.Dropout
- layers.Flatten
