My reading feeds this digital garden in a process that starts with [[id:a9d4499d-b5f4-4676-8ada-f7a5a5c38681][taking reading notes]]. I try to read only a few book at the time; the following are currently on my bedside table:

- Al Ries, The 22 immutable laws of branding.
- Jono Bacon, The art of community
- Donald Gause & Gerald Weinberg, Are your lights on?

* Contribute to my education

If, after wandering in this garden, you think there is something I should absolutely read, [[https://twitter.com/remilouf][tell me]]!
