We can interface with pretty much every low-level language that has HPC libraries : Fortran, C, C++, etc. and make it feel like a native python library. Which is good because [[id:6c148b45-66c2-42f9-afe0-76a2df38e8c7][progress is reducing the number of things we need to think about]] and python as glue allows us to only learn one language. I think this has tremendously accelerated the development of machine learning.
