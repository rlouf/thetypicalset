Economic seismograms were invented (as far as I know) by Jason Smith to visualize causality in economic time series. The idea is to sbtract the linear trend from the different time series and qualify the observed shocks. The resulting plots allow to compare many different indicators and look for and represent causal relationships.

- The code used to build them is [[https://github.com/infotranecon/IEtools/blob/master/IEtools.py][available on Github]]

The fit seems to be based on some information equilibrium arguments. Blog posts where seismograms are used and discussed:
