Bank deposits are created when a bank buys an asset or creates a loan; the deposit is destroyed as the loan or asset is repaid. They are only shuffled around in the system during transaction, but transactions do not affect the level of deposits in the system. /The amount of deposits in the system is thus linked to the level of loans in the banking system./

* TODO Graphical representation of transactions between bank. With one bank, two banks, etc.
