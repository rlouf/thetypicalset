Here are the areas in which I am confident I can improve over current material:
- Better exploration of the different variations;
  /Graph visualizations/ can probably help to [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][explore linked openings]] when we're on an opening page.
- Show side-to-side the board and the squares respectively controlled by White and Black (helpful when learning);
  To do this we can use the ==python-chess== library to get the attacked squares, and render the chessboard with $\LaTeX$'s ==chessboard== library to keep the same graphic chart.
- Show common threats in openings (which explains why some variations are never played, which is always a bit mysterious as a beginner)

* References

  It would be interesting to list all the principles that are listed in the book and check whether they are followed in such and such openings.
