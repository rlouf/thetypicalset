Treasury (debt) and Fed (monetary policy) were separated in 1951. See this [[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/treasury-fed-reserve.asp][article]] for an explanation of how they interact with each other in practice.

The *banks*:
- How much money can they loan? What are the reserve requirements?
- How can they acquire reserve?

For everything related to reserve requirements, you can read the [[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reserve-maintenance-manual-calculation-of-reserve-balance-requirements.htm][Fed's explanation of reserve balance requirements]] ([[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/reserve-maintenance-manual.pdf][PDF]]). This includes reporting timelines.

The *treasury*:
- How does it get money?

*Individuals* pay taxes, spend money and save money. Saving increases the reserves. Since Bale III banks are required to also hold High Quality Assets as reserve, often sovereign debt.
