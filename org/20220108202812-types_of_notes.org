- Syntheses which should not be part of the notes (too big)
- Project notes should be strictly be kept out of the slip box cite:ahrens2017
- Journal notes (need better name) which describe a state of affair at a given point in time and only make sense in a timeline (for instance explaining I'm discontinuing MCX)
- You need a [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5aJUJcSbxuQxzHr2YvaY4cX5TuvLQT7r27Dz][writing inbox]] (which can be used to prompt )
- Concept notes (such ac [[id:1a08425d-1fa8-4f9f-98d0-423b0d5c0991][Ornstein-Uhlenbeck kernel]]) can be added if they are processed, contain new content (beware of the  wikipedia effect)
