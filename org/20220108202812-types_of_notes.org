All notes are not created equal as they have different purposes and convey different intentions.

- [[id:6aa89dce-2716-4fa8-a1b3-04bfed1ca297][Fleeting notes should be discarded]] cite:ahrens2017;
- A [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5aJUJcSbxuQxzHr2YvaY4cX5TuvLQT7r27Dz][writing inbox]] with prompts. If you can search tags easily, this can be implemented using a =draft= tag;
- A [[id:e706f82a-1a42-4f7d-951d-800501db61c7][log is useful to collect small things]] (tweets, figures, quotes) as you go through the day;
- [[id:41c99a41-3f83-4381-8f1c-65dcb667795c][Notebooks are a collection of references]], explain why we're interested in a topic and what questions we expect to answer;
- [[id:abce7e33-2662-48fe-ac2a-496df464d106][Literature notes should be kept separate]]. They can be useful to gather quotes that may be useful later, or distill the intent / knowledge of the book. I am not sure yet what is the best way to take literature note and how they fit in this system;
- Knowledge should be distilled in Zettelkasten, if possible made [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen%5Fnotes][evergreen]];
- Larger projects, which require a lot of code and data should be kept out of the directory not only for practical purposes, but also because we intend them to be self-sufficient. It should be possible to integrate them using e.g. =git submodule= so notes can refer to them directly.
- Reports describe a state of affair at a given point in time and only make sense in a timeline (for instance explaining I'm discontinuing MCX);
- Concept notes (such ac [[id:1a08425d-1fa8-4f9f-98d0-423b0d5c0991][Ornstein-Uhlenbeck kernel]]) can be added if they are processed, contain new content (beware of the  wikipedia effect); Most of the time they're used as knowledge hubs.
