#+title: Samples in Measure Theory

What does the sentence "Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be $n$ samples from the probability distribution $f$" mean mathematically?

Let's define the probability density $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\int_\mathbb{R} f(\mu) \mathrm{d}\mu = 1$. $f$ is a density corresponding to a measure $\mathbb{P}$ with respect to, e.g., the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The rigorous meaning of the above statement is that  $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are independent /random variables/ with the same associated measure and distribution $f$. For any $r_1, \dots, r_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the probability that $x_i < r_i$ is true for all $i=1, \dots, n$ is

$$
\prod_{i=1}^n \int_{-\inf}^{r_i} f(x) \mathrm{d}x
$$
