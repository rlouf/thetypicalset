#+title: My online universe

My online universe is made of different elements:
- [[id:7dae4406-eb94-4496-93e1-a989cab14729][My digital gardne with linked notes]] corresponding to what Andy Matuschak would call /Evergreen notes/, and all [[id:ca24d16b-40b8-4c66-b3fb-bc793ecccfdf][types of notes]] that I write for myself.
- Book reviews, which are separate because [[id:ea76698c-b228-4eca-818d-0cb675b05130][Book reviews and literature notes are different things]]
- Journal entries, or blog posts
- Longer projects (pollsposition elections, chess, notes du bac, etc) added as /git submodules/. [[id:d6361b63-7810-4322-8951-88eb05a9d882][Projects are what we write for others]]
- [[id:41c99a41-3f83-4381-8f1c-65dcb667795c][Notebooks to collect references]]
