I am a terrible player; I only started playing at the end of summer 2021. I quickly became very passionate about the game but I found that the way information is presented in books and videos doesn't suit the way my brain works. While some people can suffer through someone telling them to learn this and this line from the London System, and this one from the Sicilian defense, I can't. There is no way around imposing yourself some limits to your exploration, so I needed to find those limits in a way that works for me.

** TODO Probability to win when white/black as a function of ELO
P(win|Elo1=X, Elo2=Y)

Well it turns out this can get very complicated quite quickly. We can indeed look at simple statistics, condition by ELO, condition by player in the database. Or when we try to predict player's ability we can compute an advantage as a byproduct.

** TODO Paths of different pieces on the board :noexport:
- Real paths
  + All
  + As a function of time
  + What is the difference with heatmaps?
- Show the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour][Knight's tour]], it is absolutely not obvious that knights can cover every square on the board.

  Look at this example of [[https://imgur.com/a/pYHyk/layout/grid][piece journeys]]

** TODO Compare the moves that are made compared to the ones that could have been made randomly (maybe it was the only position possible) -- forced vs free, prefered move

** TODO Position of different pieces during the game
[[https://www.kyrandale.com/viz/static/expts/d3-chess-css3d/index_squares.html][Example with Kasparov/Karpov games]]

** TODO Piece captures
Show [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/stevefaeembra/5498153784/in/photostream/][squares where captures, checks, etc occured]]



* Stats :noexport:

/All of these should be looked at f(ELO). We can probably fit distributions and then plot the parameters vs the ELO score/

** TODO Chance to win/loose/draw with whites and blacks
** TODO Distribution of game length
- As a function of ELO
** TODO Material count vs match length
** TODO Average material difference vs ply
** TODO Show motion of diffent pieces vs time
How does the rook move throughout the game? How far away from the original position is it?
** TODO Count hanging pieces
** TODO Quantify pawn structure ?
** TODO How far in the future can I recover an opening?
Use a simple machine learning algorithms that can predict the opening used from the pawn structure at a given point in the game.

** TODO Look at the branching factor
At move N how many legal moves does the player have ?

* Tactics :noexport:

** TODO Probability of blunder as a function of time remaining and ELO
Like [[https://github.com/Antiochian/chess-blunders][this repo]]
** TODO Square where the first capture happens?
** TODO Show pawn paths when they go to promotion?
** TODO Plot winning vs imbalances
** TODO BB vs BN probability of winning (# of pawns)

* Endings :noexport:

** TODO Where is the king generally checkmatted?
** TODO Are there patterns of checkmate we can isolate?
** TODO Where do pieces generally deliver checkmate?

** TODO The question we all wonder is when should we resign? We can look at the odds of winning depending on the disadvantage we're at at a given point in the game.
This give us vizualisation in [[https://web.chessdigits.com/articles/when-should-you-resign][this article]].
