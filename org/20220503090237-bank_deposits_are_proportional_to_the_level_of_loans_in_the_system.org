1. When cash is deposited at the bank;
2. When a bank issues a loan.

The loan has to be paid back with deposits; so to repay a loan another loan needs to be made somewhere. [[id:59b56bf6-b864-4ee7-9572-076727dde3d7][Debt is what sets the world in motion]]. And [[id:abd91df1-b3c9-4202-af22-f2735e68ca51][In the end the State holds the financial system together]]
