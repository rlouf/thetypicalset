One thing that pension funds allow to do in the US is to capture part of people's savings in order to re-invest in the economy. Although pension funds are likely not /a good thing/ in absolute terms, I suppose they have a virtuous "money recycling" effect.

/Isn't that what the Circuit du Tr√©sor was doing in France in a way?/
