The Reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithm is an extension of the Rosenbluth-Metropolis-Hastings algorithm where the number of dimensions of the parameter space is allowed to change.

And example of application (from Green 1995) is

#+begin_quote
the multiple changepoint model for Poisson model where the rate is supposed to be piecewise constant but changes an unknown number of times.

* Frameworks

- In Julia the PPL [[https://www.gen.dev/][Gen]] implements RJ-MCMC
- In Python [[https://github.com/aesara-devs/aehmc][AeHMC]] plans to implement RJ-MCMC
