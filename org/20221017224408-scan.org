#+title: Scan

It is actually quite simple, a =Scan= =Op= contains an inner graph and a lot of the inner logic of the =Op= is to write the inputs/outputs of the inner and outer graphs. The =tap= functionality adds a little complexity, because of storage management.

* Outer inputs
* Inner inputs
* Inner outputs
* Outer outputs
