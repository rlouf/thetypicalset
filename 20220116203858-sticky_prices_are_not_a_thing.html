<h1 class="title">Sticky prices are not a thing</h1>
<p>
Prices in an economy are like monomers in a plastic polymer polymers. Individually there is litte resistance to change, they are not "sticky" as neo-keynesians assume. Looking at all of them as a whole in an economy it becomes <i>unlikely</i> that a bunch of prices will go in the same direction. And indeed in the authors find that individual prices are not sticky, but <i>reference prices</i> are.

But again, entropic forces can be overcome with coordinated action.
