<h1 class="title">An API is good when you do not think about it</h1>
<p>
You should always <a href="20220111192552-implement_what_is_conceptually_correct.html#ID-39703634-2e4c-4dea-be05-20d75bf6466a">Implement what is conceptually correct</a> first. Once that is done you should implement the user-interface with <i>predictability</i> in mind. To do this you always need to ask yourself: "is that behavior surprising?" "what intent are these names conveying?".
</p>

<p>
An API is an artifical language on top of an artificial language (the one with which it is implemented), and should come as close as possible to a human language. So interacting with your code activates the more or less the same neural pathways as the ones you use when thinking about the problem.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the API will match exactly the problem space, but sometimes predictability will come from <i>re-using idioms that people are used to.</i> For instance JAX took off quickly because it made the right call by copying the <code>numpy</code> user interface: one just had to replace <code>numpy as np</code> with <code>jax.numpy as jnp</code> to get the same operations on <code>DeviceArray</code> that one has on <code>ndarray</code>.
