<p>
Hear me out: when we build models we usually progress iteratively by <i>rewriting</i> the model. Since we have a computation graph we could totally write the model's evolution as a series of graph rewrites and thus have a diff of the model. We can also perform graph <b>diffs</b> to understand exactly what is different between two versions of a graph.
</p>

<p>
Now if you do that it is funny, because we can explore performance of the model in the space of possible rewrites, and <i>infer</i> rewrites that might improve your model's performance even further. We could even have <i>neural guided search</i> in the space of possible rewrites to find the ideal model.
</p>

<p>
This <b>doesn't</b> sound so crazy. If we have a neural network we can define a few possible relations and let <a href="20220804135950-minikanren.html#ID-f4cf39be-6c6a-4a9d-804a-3879a98177bc">miniKanren</a> provide different versions of the same model.
