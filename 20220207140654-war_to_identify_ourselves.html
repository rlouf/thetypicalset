<h1 class="title">War to identify ourselves</h1>
<p>
Wars are most often started for self-identification and cohesion of a group than for self-defense. Focus on the <i>feelings</i> that are floating around the war talks rather than the material elements.
</p>

<p>
Both sides often benefit from the conflict. Us/ versus <i>them</i> is very useful when giving boundaries to a group. Understanding why (modern) wars happen is thus to understand why groups need to be clearly delineated.
