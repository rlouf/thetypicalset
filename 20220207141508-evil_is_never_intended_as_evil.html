<h1 class="title">Evil is never intended as evil</h1>
<p>
To do evil you need an absolute moral reference point that <i>justifies</i> actions that would otherwise be comdemable. To do evil you need to do a <i>lesser</i> evil. The notion of evil, once introduced, is indeed self-referential, and morally allows <i>more</i> evil to exist. To break the spiral is to point out that evil is non essential (nothing and no one comes to existence evil) but a construction, like Hannah Arendt did.
</p>

<p>
Look at what has happened in the late 2010s-early 2020s with the social justice movement. Members who went too far where convinced that their targets were <i>evil</i>.
</p>

<p>
Qualifying someone as <i>evil</i> is to deny their humanity.
