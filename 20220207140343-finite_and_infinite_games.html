<h1 class="title">Finite and infinite games.</h1>
<p>
p15 - "Seriousness always relates to roles, or abstractions [&#x2026;] Seriousness always has to do with an establishmed script"
</p>

<p>
p27 - "Titles are abstractions; names are always concrete"
</p>

<p>
p29 - "Too speak meaningfully of a person’s power is to speak of what that person has already completed in one or another closed field. To see power is to look backward in time.”
</p>

<p>
p33 - "Evil is never intended as evil. Indeed, the contradiction inherent in all evil is that it originates in the desire to eliminate evil."
</p>

<p>
NUMBER 31 IS THE SHIT
</p>

<p>
&gt; As societies complexify we create more and more finite games to an extreme.
</p>

<p>
p39 - Political realities do not precede, but follow from, the essential fluidity of our humanness.
</p>

<p>
p48 - It is agreement that establishes force. Those who consent to a society’s constraints see them as constraints.
</p>

<p>
Property must be seen as compensation. Risk, talent, etc
</p>

<p>
p57 - "where a society is defined by its boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizons”
</p>

<p>
p61- War presents itself for self-protection, when in fact it is necessary for self-identification.
</p>

<p>
p103 - The unspeakability of nature is the very possibility of language. History is the realm of the speakable however.
</p>

<p>
p105 - reread about explanations as a response to inadequacies in knowledge
