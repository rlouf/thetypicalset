Democracy (the vote) mediates the opinion of everyone to make a decision over one thing. Where a decentralized system would have led to more chaos. There is a tradeoff to be found between entropy reduction (ultimately authoritarian) and completely chaotic. I guess that's what designing representative systems and voting systems is about. <a href="20220116070547-complexity_is_an_issue_for_societies.html#ID-034d2ee6-65c8-4e9e-973d-a5f21150950c">Complexity is an issue for societies</a>
</p>

<p>
Decentralizing decision too much leads to an unnecessary increase in entropy. In this sense "the market" (whatever this means, <a href="20220116070250-there_is_no_such_thing_as_the_market.html#ID-b3757c5d-c47a-4b40-b34c-211061c71550">there is no such thing as "the market"</a>) cannot be an efficient solution. Asking everyone at a given point in time what they want and enforcing that choice is the best information transfer mechanism we can think of. This seems to be an argument in favor of <i>more democracy</i>, as in Switzerland.
