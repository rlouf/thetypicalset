<h1 class="title">Taxation: philosophical perspectives</h1>
<p>
Questions I hope to answer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On what basis do we justify taxation and redistribution?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Efficiency?</li>
<li>Property rights?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

There is a tension between two philosophical views of taxation:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Robert Nozick</i> argues that property rights were pre-political, and thus the state cannot interefere with these rights. It should be kept at its strict minimum to enforce these rights; transfers should operate via philantropic work. As a result, <i>Nozick</i> sees taxation as "forced labor". It has a strong influence on contemporary debates. cite:nozick1974</li>
<li><p>
For <i>John Rawls</i>, property rights are not a pre-political constraints on the operation of economical and political institutions, they are creations of the "basic structure" of society. Tax rules are also part of this basic structure. A tax system is just when it contributes to a system that satisfies the principles of justice. In his conception of Justice, Rawls endorses a steeply recipient-oriented inheritance and capital trasnfer tax. cite:rawls2020,rawls1958
