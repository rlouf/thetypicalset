<p>
A garden quickly becomes cluttered, and can quickly become unmanageable; <a href="20220822092714-you_need_to_curate_your_garden.html#ID-36a480da-b67f-4f55-8d17-fac346127e40">you need to curate your garden</a>. One of the reasons why the typical set was getting cluttered is that there was no buffer between ideas that pop in my head and the website (I <a href="20211203100731-publish_your_notes_instantly.html#ID-9b92383e-727d-4d16-9591-9730222e2d5c">publish my notes instantly</a>). At the same time, I felt I was loosing a lot of material when I was on the go and didn't have access to my machine and emacs. I needed a log to dump everything in. This way:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A lot of low-quality material, half-baked ideas don't make it here;</li>
<li>I also don't loose anything. I <i>know</i> everything is in there and that I can retrieve it later. I try to meditate more to not get attached to ideas so much, in the meantime dumping does it for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I originally tried solutions that were closer to the technology I use for this site (<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://logseq.com">logseq</a>, editing org files directly). But I am optimizing for <i>efficiency</i> here (and you should too): I just want to log the thought or the reference in a few seconds, and move on with my life. Integration with this website can be done when I am on my computer.
</p>

<p>
I use Notion which has a mobile app, and exports the log as a webpage: <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://soundslab.notion.site/soundslab/Log-c873cc5909e54faf91590c68a587841c">here is the log</a>.
