<h1 class="title">How I take reading notes</h1>
<p>
Taking notes while reading serves two purposes:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It helps me think. These notes are <i>transient</i> and do not need to be kept;</li>
<li>It helps me file important ideas for future use.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When I read a book about a <b>technical topic</b>, say bayesian inference, I open a new notebook on my Remarkable and scribble away. I come back to these <i>transient notes</i> regularly to extract the core concepts, formulas, figures, etc that I want to remember. I type these <i>permanent notes</i> directly on my computer. I sometimes use paper to organize transient notes as it is faster to re-arrange things. The transient notes should then be discarded as they clutter your mind with noise.
</p>

<p>
But this is only practical insofar as I am not reading books in the train or on my couch. For <b>lighter reading</b>, I will mark interesting paragraphs with an asterisk in the margin and take notes with an A7 (not bigger!) notepad that I always have in my pocket. I then move these pieces of paper around until I get a set of fairly self-contained, wannabe-permanent notes.
