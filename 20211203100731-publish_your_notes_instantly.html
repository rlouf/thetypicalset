<p>
There should be as little friction as possible between the act of writing and the act of publishing. Publishing almost instantly is paramout for several reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You cannot hide clutter on a web browser;</li>
<li>Publishing gives you a broader perspective. Being able to navigate through one's notes in a browser gives a perspective that you cannot get in a text editor. This is not just about finding typos or adding a few links, but about breaking down notes, merging some ideas, and sometimes gettings new ideas. It helps you <a href="20211201165647-how_to_take_notes.html#ID-d4b6bab5-96f2-417f-902d-c78e7b7d1dca">write better notes</a>.</li>
<li>Publishing is rewarding. It helps create a habit: the more you publish the more you will want to write.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are rewards you reap whenever you get something out there. But self-contained notes do not need any extra work, they can be published as is. <a href="20220111220202-progress_is_better_measured_in_small_chunks.html#ID-b035cb34-015c-4be2-a822-85b59a92c020">Progress is better measured in small chunks</a>, and published notes are proofs of your thinking evolving

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28d55a4">
<p>
There are currently too many steps between my fingers typing and you seeing this on the internet:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Save the org file</li>
<li>Go to the directory where the files for the website are located</li>
<li><code>make build</code> to re-build the modified pages</li>
<li><code>git add &amp;&amp; git commit</code>  to add the new files to the repo</li>
<li><code>git push</code> (and the site is automatically built and publish)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I need to reduce the number of keystrokes. <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui">org-roam-ui</a> is graphical frontend that can be used locally to visualize one's notes. You are made conscious of the clutter, get a broader perspective, <i>but</i> publishing online is more rewarding.
